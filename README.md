ðŸš€ VPC Peering Project ðŸš€
Overview

This project guides you through setting up VPC Peering between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS. This establishes a secure, private connection for seamless communication between the VPCs, enhancing network segmentation within your AWS environment.

Objectives

Create and configure multiple VPCs.
Establish a VPC Peering Connection to enable communication between isolated VPCs.
Configure Route Tables to route traffic between peered VPCs.
Test Peering Connectivity to ensure successful setup.
Prerequisites

AWS Account (Free tier is sufficient)
Basic knowledge of VPCs, subnets, and route tables
Familiarity with the AWS Management Console
